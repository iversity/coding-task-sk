# Coding task - Frontend Developer

As a programming task, we would like you to build a simple list view that visualises the MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) on our platform. 

Create the following:
- on initial page load show all courses currently running
- order courses by start_date
- show course cards following the mockup in this repo (be exact)
- on course card click it should reveal more information about this course (be creative)
- it should be possible to one-click-filter the courses list by [finished, current, upcoming]

Requirements:
- Implement this a a single page load, frontent only page.
- use https://iversity.org/api/v1/courses.json as the data source
- use Javascript / CSS / Html
- feel free to use any framework/library available, but we will appreciate the usage of Polymer (otherwise kittens may die)

When done, inform Gordon Friebe, g.friebe@iversity.org, and list:
- how long it took you to get the task done. Please be honest.
- what was particularly time consuming / difficult
- how much pre-knowledge you had about the involved/used technologies
- improvement suggestions to your solution (if you had more time)

We look forward to receiving your results!
